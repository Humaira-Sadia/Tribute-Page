                    <h1>Biography</h1>
                    <p>
                        Elon Musk is an inventor and an engineer. He is the owner of, among other things, Tesla Motors
                        and SpaceX. Musk is a genius and will go down as one of the greatest engineers the world has
                        ever seen. He is pushing the boundaries of science and technology with his ambitions in electric
                        power and space. Like a true engineer, he has developed solutions for the problems of modern
                        civilization. He has plans to solve our traffic problems with autonomous cars and tunnel
                        networks. Perhaps more remarkable, he has plans to eliminate most of our fossil fuel dependence
                        and switch to cleaner and more sustainable sources of energy.

                        Musk was long convinced that for life to survive, humanity has to become a multiplanet species.
                        However, he was dissatisfied with the great expense of rocket launchers. In 2002 he founded
                        Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) to make more affordable rockets. Its first two rockets
                        were the Falcon 1 (first launched in 2006) and the larger Falcon 9 (first launched in 2010),
                        which were designed to cost much less than competing rockets. A third rocket, the Falcon Heavy
                        (first launched in 2018), was designed to carry 117,000 pounds (53,000 kg) to orbit, nearly
                        twice as much as its largest competitor, the Boeing Company’s Delta IV Heavy, for one-third the
                        cost. SpaceX has announced the successor to the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy: the Super
                        Heavy–Starship system. The Super Heavy first stage would be capable of lifting 100,000 kg
                        (220,000 pounds) to low Earth orbit. The payload would be the Starship, a spacecraft designed
                        for providing fast transportation between cities on Earth and building bases on the Moon and
                        Mars. SpaceX also developed the Dragon spacecraft, which carries supplies to the International
                        Space Station (ISS). Dragon can carry as many as seven astronauts, and it had a crewed flight
                        carrying astronauts Doug Hurley and Robert Behnken to the ISS in 2020. The first test flights of
                        the Super Heavy–Starship system launched in 2020. In addition to being CEO of SpaceX, Musk was
                        also chief designer in building the Falcon rockets, Dragon, and Starship. SpaceX is contracted
                        to build the lander for the astronauts returning to the Moon by 2025 as part of NASA’s Artemis
                        space program.

                        Musk had long been interested in the possibilities of electric cars, and in 2004 he became one
                        of the major funders of Tesla Motors (later renamed Tesla), an electric car company founded by
                        entrepreneurs Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. In 2006 Tesla introduced its first car, the
                        Roadster, which could travel 245 miles (394 km) on a single charge. Unlike most previous
                        electric vehicles, which Musk thought were stodgy and uninteresting, it was a sports car that
                        could go from 0 to 60 miles (97 km) per hour in less than four seconds. In 2010 the company’s
                        initial public offering raised about $226 million. Two years later Tesla introduced the Model S
                        sedan, which was acclaimed by automotive critics for its performance and design. The company won
                        further praise for its Model X luxury SUV, which went on the market in 2015. The Model 3, a
                        less-expensive vehicle, went into production in 2017 and became the best-selling electric car of
                        all time.

                        Musk joined the social media service Twitter in 2009, and, as @elonmusk, he became one of the
                        most popular accounts on the site, with more than 85 million followers as of 2022. He expressed
                        reservations about Tesla’s being publicly traded, and in August 2018 he made a series of tweets
                        about taking the company private at a value of $420 per share, noting that he had “secured
                        funding.” (The value of $420 was seen as a joking reference to April 20, a day celebrated by
                        devotees of cannabis.) The following month the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
                        sued Musk for securities fraud, alleging that the tweets were “false and misleading.” Shortly
                        thereafter Tesla’s board rejected the SEC’s proposed settlement, reportedly because Musk had
                        threatened to resign. However, the news sent Tesla stock plummeting, and a harsher deal was
                        ultimately accepted. Its terms included Musk’s stepping down as chairman for three years, though
                        he was allowed to continue as CEO; his tweets were to be preapproved by Tesla lawyers, and fines
                        of $20 million for both Tesla and Musk were levied.
